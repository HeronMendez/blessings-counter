Blessings Counter App

This application is the result of a JavaScript practice project that I developed as part of the "Learn Javascript" course on Scrimba(https://v2.scrimba.com/). The main purpose of this project is to learn and apply basic concepts of the language while creating something useful and meaningful.

Description:
Blessings Counter App is a simple yet powerful tool that invites you to reflect on the blessings in your daily life. With this app, you can keep track of those small moments of gratitude that we often overlook. Whenever you feel blessed, just press the button to count it. At the end of the day, you can save the total, giving yourself a moment to pause and recognize how blessed you are in many ways, even in the smallest ones.
